Sistema em PHP com Laravel 4 para geração, validação e envio do XML Cadastral e Financeiro para a ANS


## Recommendations
I recommend that you use Grunt to compile and minify your assets. See this [article](http://blog.elenakolevska.com/using-grunt-with-laravel-and-bootstrap) for details.

Also I recommend using [Former](http://anahkiasen.github.io/former/) for your forms. It's an excellent library.

### Step 6: Populate Database
Run these commands to create and populate Users table:

	php artisan migrate
	php artisan db:seed

### Step 7: Set Encryption Key
***In app/config/app.php***

```
/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Encryption Key
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| This key is used by the Illuminate encrypter service and should be set
| to a random, long string, otherwise these encrypted values will not
| be safe. Make sure to change it before deploying any application!
|
*/
```

	'key' => 'YourSecretKey!!!',

You can use artisan to do this

    php artisan key:generate --env=local

The `--env` option allows defining which environment you would like to apply the key generation. In our case, artisan generates your key in ***app/config/local/app.php*** and leaves ***'YourSecretKey!!!'*** in ***app/config/app.php***. Now it can be generated again when you move the project to another environment.

### Step 8: Make sure app/storage is writable by your web server.

If permissions are set correctly:

    chmod -R 775 app/storage

Should work, if not try

    chmod -R 777 app/storage

### Step 9: Start Page (Three options for proceeding)

### User login with commenting permission
Navigate to your Laravel 4 website and login at /user/login:

    username : user
    password : user

## Create a new user
Create a new user at /user/create

### Admin login
Navigate to /admin

    username: admin
    password: admin

## Application Structure

The structure of this starter site is the same as default Laravel 4 with one exception.
This starter site adds a `library` folder. Which, houses application specific library files.
The files within library could also be handled within a composer package, but is included here as an example.

## Detect Language

If you want to detect teh language on all pages you'll want to add the following to your routes.php at the top.

    Route::when('*','detectLang');


### Development

For ease of development you'll want to enable a couple useful packages. This requires editing the `app/config/app.php` file.

```
    'providers' => array(

        [...]

        /* Uncomment for use in development */
//        'Way\Generators\GeneratorsServiceProvider', // Generators
//        'Barryvdh\LaravelIdeHelper\IdeHelperServiceProvider', // IDE Helpers

    ),
```
Uncomment the Generators and IDE Helpers. Then you'll want to run a composer update with the dev flag.

```
php composer.phar update
```
This adds the generators and ide helpers.
To make it build the ide helpers automatically you'll want to modify the post-update-cmd in `composer.json`

```
		"post-update-cmd": [
			"php artisan ide-helper:generate",
			"php artisan optimize"
		]
```

### Production Launch

By default debugging is enabled. Before you go to production you should disable debugging in `app/config/app.php`

```
    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Application Debug Mode
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | When your application is in debug mode, detailed error messages with
    | stack traces will be shown on every error that occurs within your
    | application. If disabled, a simple generic error page is shown.
    |
    */

    'debug' => false,
```

## Troubleshooting

## Composer asking for login / password

Try using this with doing the install instead.

    composer install --dev --prefer-source --no-interaction
